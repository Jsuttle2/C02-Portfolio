               <h1>Hey there, I'm Jake</h1>
                <p>I'm a graphic designer, disc golf and craft brewing enthusiast, avid reader, and generally good human being. I like to solve problems. I like to make systems more efficient. Sometimes my parents call me lazy but I always say that laziness is the mother of invention. I’ve been studying and collecting skills for a while; first with an Associates in Advertising and Graphic Design from CPCC and now with a BFA in Art with an emphasis on Graphic Design at UNCC. Before that I majored in Musical Theatre, Marketing, and Teaching each for a year or so, which means I have a tonne of random skills, but I’ve found Design to be my true calling and passion.  I’m proficient in Adobe Creative Suite, I’ve learned 3D modeling in Blender, Meshmixer and Rhino, and have developed analogue fabrication skills.

				<br>	
			    I’m confident I can pick up any program I don’t already know quickly. 
				Primarily my interests lie in typography and layout whether that be for print of web, but lately I’ve found that I also really enjoy exploring analogue solutions as well. I really like illustration too, although I wouldn’t call myself great at it, but I have my own style. I’ve also found out that I really enjoy video editing. I work really well in groups, I’m not afraid to speak my mind and float my thoughts around. I’m an idea man. At times I have trouble developing ideas to completion by myself, but get me another person or two to bounce ideas off of and we’re golden.
				Let's hang out grab a beer and throw a few holes sometime.</p>
